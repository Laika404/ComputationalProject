This project models traffic on a micro level using agents to simulate the
decision-making of many individual drivers.

## Requirements
We use Python 3.10 along with the following libaries:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
These may be installed manually with pip or through Anaconda. To automatically
install them in a `venv` you can use the following commands:
```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running/plotting
To run the model along with the code that plots the resulting data, run the
following command:
```sh
python model.py
```
